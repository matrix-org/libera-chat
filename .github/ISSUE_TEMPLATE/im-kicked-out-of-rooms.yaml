          Every user that is not active in any Libera Chat channel for 30 days is automatically kicked by the idle kicker. 

          You can list the rooms you are currently into that are bridged to Libera Chat by opening a DM with `@appservice:libera.chat` and sending `!listrooms`.
          If you were not active in any of these rooms, this is why the idle-kicker removed you.

          You an also regularly (more often than every 30 days) send `!active` to `@appservice:libera.chat` in DM to manifest yourself as an active user and avoid being kicked by the idle kicker.
